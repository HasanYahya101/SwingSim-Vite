# SwingSim (React + Vite)

## Introduction

This visualization demonstrates how chaos increases in a pendulum system as you add more joints. The motion becomes increasingly unpredictable and complex with each additional joint. Observe the fading paths to see the chaotic trajectories of each joint. The larger circle at the top represents the fixed point where the pendulum is attached.

## UI Library

Radix UI and ShadCN components were used to create the UI of the website. Moreover, Vite was used to create this React Project.

## Deployment

This project was deployed to Github Pages and can be tested there. No servers or databases were used in this Project.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
